What's changed:
***************

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

- Everything needs a review and fixes.
- Not refactored: nav-tabs.less and whole javascript section.
- Structure needs refactor - side navigation renders only 2nd level that is insufficient in Components section.

TODO:
- Think about removing common variables like $padding-large-vertical
- It's time to refactor list-group - problem is when there is ul, li not only div and links inside.
  It is completely broken.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Old offsets used to be multiplication by 5.
That means 5px offset turns into 4px (1rem * 0.25) etc. See BS4 $spacers.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
