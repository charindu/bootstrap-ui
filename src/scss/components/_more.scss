/*
More Link

Responsive link to a complete listing. Works best with H2.

By default, more link is aligned to baseline with the element that has space of one line between itself
and the following content. The value corresponds to default bottom margin of H2 (which is one line)
and can be adjusted via LESS variable `$more-link-top-offset`.

<div class="card card-info">
    <div class="card-heading"><h4 class="card-title">Heads Up!</h4></div>
    <div class="card-body">
        It may be a little bit confusing to distinguish between the Back Link and More Link components.
        They both appear on the right side of the heading on big screens, but they are designed
        in a different way for mobiles.
